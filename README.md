# Daily NHL Fantasy Team Selector

## Purpose

This project was intended to explore the use of the NHL API, BeautifulSoup for web-scraping and apply that to Daily Fantasy Hockey, specifically FanDuel. The selection of the team, and fpp (projected fantasy points) is based off the players last 5 games in the league (or less if the player has not reached 5 games). In addition, the salary is taken from an outside source unrelated to Fanduel, however it is updated daily and proven to be accurate.

## Feature Overview

*Currently only support for players last 5 games*

* Daily Fantasy Team Selection 

* List of Daily Matchups

* List of Team's Lineups

* List of Bargain Player's (fpp/salary)

## Some Notes

Future updates to this project is to provide a more accurate model for team selection. This can be done by taking advantage of the NHL API to it's fullest capabilities by using players stats from previous seasons to find trends in their play, teams performance, and more. Due to University and other projects these changes may take more time to implement, but provided I maintain playing Daily Fantasy Hockey my interest will continue to be improving the team selection model and providing a more analytically accurate team.
